# Inspiration

Ever dig out something from your closet that you forgot you even owned? We decided to create an application that allows you to track every clothing item in your wardrobe, seamlessly integrated with a styling assistant that provides personalized advice.

# Features

## Virtual Closet

- Automatic background removal upon item upload
- Four preset categories (Tops, Bottoms, Shoes, Accessories)

## Styling Assistant

- Weather-based recommendations for both implicit (local) and explicitly-specified location
- Tuned to styling preferences indicated at user registration
- Real-time product fetching with images and links via Google Shopping API!
- Generate outfit around an item you've uploaded
- How we built it
- We used React.js for our frontend, Django for our backend, Firebase for authentication, storage, and database functionality

# What's next for CoutureLab

- Adding the ability for users to combine their uploaded items into outfits
- Generate an outfit given several uploaded items to start off with
- Improving the questionnaire
